Depth-based Toon Point Rendering

Author: Sean Brown
UCID: 10062604

Description:

This is a rendering system specialized in points
and is built to be extensible and efficient. It's
purpose is to render points and implement a multitude
of features related to points. The included features
are as follows:

- texture mapping
- size variation based on depth
- texture variation based on depth
- size controlled by user
- color change by user

Instructions:

Required files and folders:

-The textures folder must be in the same folder as the
main executable file. 
-This program uses gltb so gltb.h and gltb.cpp must be
in the same folder as main.

To compile and run:

- While in the folder containing main

1) call "make"
2) call "./main"

Controls:

1 -------- White Background
2 -------- Black Background
a -------- decreases division of distance
s -------- increases division of distance
x -------- decreases size coefficient
z -------- increases size coefficient
e -------- decreases radius cutoff
r -------- increases radius cutoff
q -------- increase color divide distance
w -------- decrease color divide distance
RMB ------ menu
